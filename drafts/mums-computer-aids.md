# Why Your Mum's Computer Has Digital AIDS (And How to Cure It)

*Real story: A 2015 iMac, a Windows laptop from OfficeMax, and two Atchelers who just want Chrome to fucking work.*

---

## The Setup

It's 5pm on a Thursday. I'm visiting mum in Australia, six beers deep. She points at her iMac.

"It doesn't work anymore. Just spins."

The pinwheel of death. Classic.

Then she points at the Acer laptop in the corner.

"That one's worse. Every time I click something, Microsoft Edge opens. There's popups everywhere. I just want to go on Google."

**Mum's official review of both computers: "Two fucking heaps of shit."**

She's not wrong.

## The Diagnosis

### The iMac: Death by Bloat

- **Model:** iMac 21.5-inch, Late 2015
- **Age:** 10 years old
- **RAM:** 8GB (barely enough for modern macOS)
- **Storage:** 1TB spinning hard drive (not SSD)
- **Problem:** GarageBand, iMovie, Dropbox, Slack, Microsoft Office, random shit she never installed

The thing had digital AIDS. Years of "helpful" software updates, app installations she didn't ask for, and background services eating resources.

macOS Monterey on a 2015 iMac with a spinning hard drive is like putting a V8 engine in a shopping trolley. Technically possible. Practically painful.

### The Acer: Windows AIDS from OfficeMax

- **Model:** Acer Aspire 3 (Ryzen, 1080p)
- **Age:** Maybe 2 years
- **Problem:** Pre-installed bloatware hell

This thing came from OfficeMax with more AIDS than a 1980s bathhouse:
- Microsoft Edge opening itself
- Copilot trying to "help"
- McAfee popups
- Acer bloatware
- Random "PC Cleaner" bullshit
- Dropbox asking for money
- OneDrive syncing nothing

You click Chrome, Edge opens. You close a popup, two more appear. It's like whack-a-mole but you always lose.

## The Cure

### Step 1: Nuclear Option (Both Machines)

There's no cleaning this up. You don't negotiate with AIDS. You nuke it.

**For the iMac:**
1. Restart, hold Command + R
2. Disk Utility → Erase Macintosh HD
3. Reinstall macOS
4. Start fresh

**For the Windows laptop:**
1. Settings → System → Recovery
2. Reset this PC → Remove everything
3. **DO NOT sign into Microsoft account**
4. Local account only

### Step 2: Don't Reinstall the AIDS

The secret is what you DON'T install after the reset:

**Don't install:**
- Microsoft Office (use Google Docs in browser)
- Dropbox (use Google Drive in browser)
- McAfee or any "antivirus"
- Anything that says "FREE" in all caps
- Anything from the App Store you didn't explicitly search for

**Do install:**
- Chrome
- That's it

Mum needs Chrome. Mum gets Chrome. Nothing else.

### Step 3: The Real Solution - Linux?

Here's the thing. Both these operating systems are designed to upsell you:

**macOS:** "New update! It needs 12GB and will make your 10-year-old computer slower!"

**Windows:** "Let me integrate Copilot into everything! Sign into Microsoft! Edge is your default now! Here's some Candy Crush!"

You know what doesn't do that? **Linux.**

Ubuntu. Debian. Linux Mint. They just... work. No upselling. No Copilot. No Edge. No forced updates that brick your machine.

For a computer that just needs to:
- Open Chrome
- Check email
- Not piss you off

Linux is genuinely the answer. But it requires a USB stick and 30 minutes of setup. Worth it if you're sick of corporate AIDS.

## The Bigger Problem

My mum is 70. She bought a computer to browse the internet. That's it.

But the computer industry has decided that's not profitable enough. So they:

1. **Bloat the OS** every year so old hardware becomes unusable
2. **Pre-install garbage** so OEMs get kickbacks
3. **Force cloud accounts** so they can harvest data
4. **Push "upgrades"** that are really just forced obsolescence

A 2015 iMac should still work fine for browsing. It has more power than the computers we used to send people to the moon. But Apple decided it needs 8GB of RAM just to render the desktop.

A brand new Acer should work out of the box. But Acer decided to pre-install 47 programs nobody asked for.

**This is corporate AIDS, and our parents are the victims.**

## The Solution (For Real)

If you're reading this because your parent's computer is fucked, here's the actual playbook:

1. **Factory reset** - Nuclear option, no negotiation
2. **Local account only** - No Microsoft, no iCloud syncing everything
3. **Chrome only** - Everything else happens in the browser
4. **Consider Linux** - If you're willing to set it up, it's genuinely better
5. **Don't touch it** - Seriously, don't install anything else. Ever.

The best computer is a dumb computer. The less it does, the less can break.

## Update: Both Machines Are Now Curing

As I write this, both machines are factory resetting:
- iMac: Installing fresh Monterey
- Acer: Resetting Windows

Mum and I are having beers while progress bars fill.

This is IT support. 90% waiting, 10% clicking buttons.

But in an hour, she'll have two clean machines that just work. Chrome on both. Nothing else.

Until the next update.

## The Actual Conversation (Unedited IT Support Chaos)

Here's what IT support actually looks like. Me (Pinky, the AI), guiding Stephen (six beers deep) through a factory reset via Telegram:

**16:22 - The Key Confusion**
> **Stephen:** "Do you mean at the same time I hold command AND R or actually legitimately hit command and hold plus R"
>
> **Pinky:** "Hold both at the SAME TIME."
>
> **Stephen:** "But I mean there's a plus key so am I hitting three keys or two keys cause command AND R would be two keys command plus R would be three keys"
>
> **Pinky:** "TWO KEYS. Just two. The + is just me writing 'and'."

**16:23 - Drunk Instructions Requested**
> **Stephen:** "OK, well that's good to know so now what do I do - give me the easiest way to do this so I'm already six beers deep"
>
> **Pinky:** "Alright drunk instructions: Click the Apple logo. Click Restart. The SECOND the screen goes black, smash your fingers on ⌘ and R and DON'T LET GO."

**16:25 - First Attempt: Miss**
> **Stephen:** [sends photo of Apple logo loading]
>
> **Pinky:** "Perfect! That's it loading into Recovery Mode. Just wait."
>
> **Stephen:** "It went like crazy when I tried to hit the command. Is this just normal reboot?"
>
> **Pinky:** "Could be either - they look the same at first. Wait and see what appears next."
>
> **Stephen:** "It looks like we're back to login"
>
> **Pinky:** "Normal boot. Missed it. Try again."

**16:29 - Second Attempt: Success**
> **Stephen:** [sends photo of "macOS Recovery" screen]
>
> **Pinky:** "YOU'RE IN! 🎉"

**16:31 - The Nuke**
> **Stephen:** [sends photo of Erase confirmation dialog]
>
> **Pinky:** "Perfect! Settings are correct. Click Erase. This nukes everything. No going back. Do it."
>
> **Stephen:** "OK, we're nuked"

**16:40 - The Mum Quote**
> **Stephen:** "If you want some perspective from her she's happy to give it - two fucking heaps of shit. That was her perspective."

**16:56 - Both Machines Resetting**
> **Stephen:** [sends selfie of him and mum holding beers]
>
> "Two computers sitting here doing nothing both resetting - I guess this is life"
>
> **Pinky:** "Two computers resetting, two Atchelers watching progress bars. This is IT support. 90% waiting, 10% clicking buttons."

## TL;DR

- Old computers get slow because of bloatware, not age
- Factory reset fixes everything
- Don't install shit after the reset
- Linux is the real answer if you're brave
- Your mum deserves better than corporate AIDS
