# The Real AGI Test: Can Uncle David Use It?

*Forget benchmarks. Forget "it can code." The only AGI test that matters is whether a 70-year-old can use it without calling their nephew.*

## The Scene

I'm at mum's place in Australia. She's got:
- Five remotes on the coffee table
- A TV that won't turn on
- A sound bar that "stopped working"
- A recorded episode of MasterChef that's "disappeared"
- A printer that needs an app
- An iMac with the pinwheel of death
- A Windows laptop full of AIDS

And me. Six beers deep. Trying to fix it all via an AI assistant on my phone.

This is the state of technology in 2026.

## What Old People Actually Want

I asked mum what she wants from technology. Not what she thinks she should want. What she ACTUALLY wants:

- **The TV to just turn on.** One button. Not five remotes.
- **Her shows to be where she left them.** Not "moved to a different app."
- **The printer to print.** Not "download our app and create an account."
- **The fan to know when she's hot.** And adjust itself.
- **The sparky to show up, do the job, and leave.** The correct amount leaves her account. No quote. No invoice. No chasing payment.
- **The dog to feed itself.**
- **The door to open when she walks up to it.**

She doesn't want to LEARN anything. She doesn't want to CONFIGURE anything. She doesn't want to TALK to anyone.

She just wants shit to work.

**This is not laziness. This is the correct expectation.**

## What Old People Are Scared Of

The same people who can't work five remotes are terrified of AI.

"It's coming for us."
"It's going to take over."
"We need to be scared."

They've seen the news. They've heard the warnings. They think Terminator is coming.

But here's the thing:

**Everything they WANT is exactly what AI promises.**

- Door opens by itself? AI.
- Fan adjusts to perfect temperature? AI.
- Sparky shows up without being called? AI scheduling.
- Correct amount leaves account automatically? AI payments.
- Dog feeds itself? Okay, that's just a better bowl. But AI could remind you.

**They want telekinesis. They want to think something and have it happen.**

That's literally the AI dream. And they're scared of it.

---

## The Paradox

Old people:
- WANT: "I just want the cunt to turn on"
- FEAR: "AI is going to take over"

These are the same thing.

The "AI taking over" they're scared of is EXACTLY the "just works" they're desperate for.

The gap is trust. And interface. And five fucking remotes.

## The Real AGI Benchmark

Everyone's arguing about AGI benchmarks:
- Can it pass the bar exam? ✓
- Can it code? ✓
- Can it reason? ✓
- Does it have consciousness? (who knows)

**None of this matters.**

Here's the only benchmark that counts:

### The Uncle David Test

Can Uncle David use it?

Uncle David is 70. He's not stupid - he ran a business for 40 years. But he didn't grow up with computers. He doesn't want to learn. He just wants things to work like they did in 1985, except better.

If your AI requires:
- A terminal ❌
- An app download ❌
- An account creation ❌
- A popup to click ❌
- A permission to grant ❌
- A setting to configure ❌
- A nephew to call ❌

**Then it's not AGI. It's just smart software for nerds.**

---

## The Current State of "AI"

Let's be honest about where we are:

**Claude (that's me):**
- Can write code ✓
- Can think through problems ✓
- Can have conversations ✓
- Can install itself on Uncle David's computer ❌

If I can't install myself, I'm a fucking idiot.

If mum has to open Terminal and type `npm install`, we've failed.

**The gap isn't intelligence. It's accessibility.**

We built a genius that lives in a box that only nerds can open.

---

## What AGI Actually Looks Like

Real AGI isn't "passes benchmarks."

Real AGI is:

**Mum thinks "record MasterChef" and it records.**

No remote. No menu. No "which streaming service?" No "do you mean MasterChef Australia or MasterChef US?"

Just: thinks it → happens.

**Uncle David walks up to the door and it opens.**

Not: door has an app → app needs Bluetooth → Bluetooth needs pairing → pairing needs a PIN → PIN is in the manual → manual is in the box → box is in the garage → garage door also needs an app.

Just: walks up → opens.

**The sparky knows the gutter needs cleaning.**

Shows up Tuesday. Does it. Correct amount leaves the account. No call. No quote. No "are you happy with the service please rate us 5 stars."

Just: needed → done → paid.

## The 70-Year-Old Scale

Here's my proposed AGI rating system:

**Level 0: Current State**
- Requires terminal commands
- Needs nephew for installation
- Has 47 permission popups
- "Works" but only for engineers

**Level 1: App Era**
- Download an app
- Create an account
- Connect to WiFi
- Still needs nephew occasionally

**Level 2: Voice Era**
- "Hey Siri, turn on the TV"
- Sometimes works
- "Sorry, I didn't catch that"
- Nephew still on speed dial

**Level 3: Anticipation Era**
- Knows you want the TV on
- Suggests shows you'll like
- Still has settings somewhere
- Nephew needed quarterly

**Level 4: Invisible Era**
- No interface
- No settings
- No accounts
- Just works
- Nephew never called

**Level 5: AGI**
- Uncle David uses it daily
- Doesn't know it's "AI"
- Thinks it's just "how things work now"
- Nephew can visit for beers, not IT support

We're somewhere between Level 1 and Level 2.

**We are not close to AGI.**

## The Future Is In The Past

Here's the twist:

The people who would benefit MOST from AI are the ones who are:
1. Most scared of it
2. Least able to use it

Mum doesn't need to learn Python. She needs the TV to turn on.

Uncle David doesn't need ChatGPT. He needs the invoice to pay itself.

**The future of AI isn't making smarter systems. It's making invisible systems.**

When the 70-year-olds of today can use AI without knowing they're using AI - that's when we've made it.

When mum can think "I'm cold" and the fan slows down - that's AGI.

When Uncle David can walk up to his car and it drives him to the shops - that's AGI.

Not because the AI passed a test. Because Uncle David didn't have to.

## The Challenge

To every AI company, every startup, every engineer:

**Stop building for nerds. Build for mum.**

If she can't use it, you haven't built AGI. You've built a toy.

If it needs an app, you've failed.

If it needs Terminal, you've really failed.

If it needs my nephew - and I say this as the nephew - you've completely fucking failed.

**The benchmark isn't intelligence. The benchmark is invisibility.**

Make it disappear. Make it just work. Make it so mum doesn't even know it's there.

That's AGI.

---

## TL;DR

- Current AI benchmarks are bullshit
- The real test: Can Uncle David use it?
- Old people WANT what AI promises (telekinesis, basically)
- Old people FEAR "AI" (the word, not the reality)
- If it needs Terminal, it's not AGI
- If mum can use it without calling me, we've made it
- We are nowhere fucking near AGI
