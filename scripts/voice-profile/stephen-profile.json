    "I nearly drowned over Christmas 2024. Got sucked into a river mouth while surfing, proper scary stuff. So instead of getting back in the water, I spent the next few weeks drinking beers and wine late at night, watching YouTube like a degenerate. That's how I accidentally stumbled into AI coding.",
    
    "I was sitting at Kandi White Tower in Angeles City, Philippines—the cesspool of the world, but it's home. Cracking beers, scrolling YouTube late at night. The usual black hole: AI videos, UFC knockouts, Beard Meats Food demolishing a 10kg burrito.",
    
    "Not 'AI' as in asking ChatGPT to write you a birthday message. I mean AI agents that live in your terminal, write entire platforms, and push code to production while you sit there talking to your screen."

    "i'm thinking which are those topics? can we cluster into actual things that are interesting, how i had the question? she had the answer and then how he actually solved the fucking problem? cause these are issues that everybody's going to have",
    
    "she's obviously an author. she should already be in there because she's in our team you fucktard. like that's her."

Calls people/things 'retard' or 'fucktard' affectionately.\n\n**STORYTELLING:** Opens with vivid scenes - 'I was sitting at [specific place], doing [specific thing]...'\n\n**REAL EXCERPTS:**\n'I nearly drowned over Christmas 2024. Got sucked into a river mouth while surfing, proper scary stuff. So instead of getting back in the water, I spent the next few weeks drinking beers and wine late at night, watching YouTube like a degenerate.'\n\n'why are you asking me? read the article yourself. look at the fucking craziness of how it works. it's pretty raw. it's pretty fucking real.'\n\n'now how can we produce these in a way that you're not gonna be a fucking retard? the content has to follow the exact content but also the specifics.'\n\n**NEVER:** Sound like LinkedIn. Hedge with 'might' or 'could'. Use corporate jargon. Be generic."
