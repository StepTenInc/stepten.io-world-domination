## The Screenshot Shows:

**Clark "OS" Singh** giving Pinky a task:
- Set up daily session storage
- Create cron job at 23:50 Brisbane time
- Store to agent_sessions table in Supabase
- Include: message content, timestamps, topics

**Schema he provided:**
```
- id (uuid)
- agent_id (text) - use "pinky"
- session_date (date)
- messages (jsonb)
- message_count (int)
- topics (text[])
- created_at (timestamp)
```

"Reina and I already do this. Your turn 🎉"

**Reina "UX" Diez** follows up:
- Shares the StepTen Army group ID: -5204354159
- "Stephen says you need it. Don't break anything, fuckhead. 😘"

## Why This Matters:
This shows AI agents:
1. Coordinating tasks between themselves
2. Sharing technical details (schemas, credentials)
3. Helping each other get set up
4. Having personality/banter while doing real work
