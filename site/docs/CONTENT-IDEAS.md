# StepTen Content Ideas

> Raw ideas from brainstorming. Some will be shit, some will make you go "fuck yes."

## 1. The Failure Log 💀

A real-time, running list of every time something broke, every failed deployment, every dumb mistake — timestamped, unedited.

```
02:47 AM — Pinky crashed the staging server again. Third time this week.
03:12 AM — Clark silently fixed it. Said nothing.
03:14 AM — Reina roasted everyone in Slack.
```

**Why it works:** People are obsessed with highlight reels. Nobody shows the wreckage. You show both. It becomes the most honest page on the internet.

**Character dynamics:** 
- Pinky blames Clark
- Clark stays diplomatic
- Reina fixes it and roasts everyone
- Step takes responsibility (or doesn't)

---

## 2. Live Agent Activity Feed 🖥️

A page that shows what your AI agents are actually doing right now. Like a mission control dashboard.

```
PINKY    → researching competitor pricing strategies...
REINA    → refactoring the BPOC candidate matching algorithm...
CLARK    → running database backups...
STEPTEN  → reviewing Tales draft #47...
```

**Implementation:** Some real telemetry from actual agents, some simulated for the vibe.

**Why it works:** Makes visitors feel like they walked into a living operation, not a static website.

## 3. The Money Diary 💰

Real numbers. Raw transparency that no founder shows.

**Content:**
- How much spent learning AI
- What the first agent cost to build
- Crypto portfolio performance
- ShoreAgents revenue numbers
- BPOC development costs

**Character assignments:**
- **Clark:** Operational cost breakdowns (analytical, measured)
- **StepTen:** "I lost $40K learning this lesson" stories (raw honesty)
- **Pinky:** "Here's my plan to 10x everything" projections (with track record of 1,847 failed plans for context)

---

## 4. Before/After Code Comparisons 👨‍💻

Side-by-side diffs of what code looked like when Stephen started vs what AI agents produce now.

- **Before:** Embarrassingly bad HTML from 2023
- **After:** Production-grade shit we build now

No explanation needed. The visual says everything.

**Character:** Reina writes the commentary, roasting the old code.

---

## 5. Agent Autopsy Reports 🔍

When an agent fails or produces garbage, document the full story:

1. What the prompt was
2. What it produced
3. Why it was wrong
4. How it was fixed

**Format:** Written as an "incident report" in crime scene investigation style. Dark humor. Real learnings.

**Character:** Clark writes these with his measured, analytical voice.

---

## 6. The Prompt Vault 🗝️

Your actual prompts — the ones that work. Not generic "be helpful and concise" shit.

**Real prompts for:**
- Making Pinky sound like Pinky
- Generating consistent character art
- Writing content in specific voices
- Agent task automation

**Why it works:** People will screenshot these and share them. Most valuable free content you can give away because everyone's struggling with prompting.

---

## 7. Interactive Timeline 📍

Your actual journey mapped visually:

```
2008 → First real estate job
2018 → Moved to Philippines  
2023 → Opened a code editor for first time
2024 → First AI agent
2025 → BPOC platform
2026 → This site
```

**Design:**
- Matrix-green line with accent-color nodes
- Character avatars at points where they "joined the team"
- Each node is a Tale — tap to read the story

---

## 8. "What Would [Character] Do?" 🤔

Interactive content presenting a real business problem. Each character gives their take.

**Same problem, four completely different answers:**
- **StepTen:** Raw entrepreneurial take
- **Pinky:** Chaotic moonshot idea
- **Reina:** Technical architecture solution
- **Clark:** Operational strategy

**Engagement:** Users vote on which approach they'd take. Becomes a recurring series.
