## PINKY AND THE BRAIN - Content Gold

### The Setup (Every Episode)
**Pinky:** "Gee Brain, what are we gonna do tonight?"
**Brain:** "The same thing we do every night, Pinky... try to take over the world!"

→ **Business Lesson:** Show up every day with the same mission. Consistency beats talent.

### Classic Moments to Reference:

1. **"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?"**
   - Brain has complex plan
   - Pinky's response is always hilariously wrong
   - **Lesson:** Your team might not see your vision yet. Communicate better or find people who get it.

2. **Brain's Plans Always Fail**
   - Overthinking, overcomplicating
   - **Lesson:** Sometimes the simple approach wins. Stop being too clever.

3. **Pinky Accidentally Saves the Day**
   - The "dumb" one stumbles into success
   - **Lesson:** Action beats analysis paralysis. Just fucking do something.

4. **"NARF!" and "POIT!"**
   - Pinky's nonsense words
   - **Lesson:** Have fun. Business doesn't have to be serious all the time.

5. **They Never Give Up**
   - Fail every episode, back at it next episode
   - **Lesson:** Failure is just Tuesday. Get up and try again.

### Episode Ideas to Research:
- The one where they try to control the world through television
- The one where Pinky becomes smart temporarily
- The one where they almost succeed (what went wrong?)
