- Drinking red wine in room with missus
- **YouTube video popped up about Replit**
- "Fuck me this is crazy"

### The Tool Journey
1. **Replit** - got excited

3. **Cursor** - "best discovery"
4. **Supabase** - learned database tables
5. **SQL** - "fucking hate SQL"
6. **Prisma** - then got rid of it
7. **Python** - for automations and executing code
8. **Railway** - couldn't see databases

### What He Had to Learn
- Database tables, relationships, constraints
- PostgreSQL, SQL servers
- Deployment
- Storage buckets
- CSS and Tailwind
- Shadcn components
- GitHub - repos, branches, push/pull
- Turbo repos
- Context/memory limitations

### The Grind
- **~50 projects** built, tested, deleted
- **6 hours/day, 6 days/week** for basically a year
- 14-hour days sometimes
- Since October 2024 trying to use staff
- Team of 6 devs for ShoreAgents.com and BPOC.io

### Key Realizations
> "Devs suck at fucking AI coding because they take too long and they're too meticulous"
> "I've tried every way to just let this cunt run as far as it will"
> "I've fucked up my own projects beyond repair, just delete and start again"

### Development Philosophy
- Do the database first
- Skin up the prototype
- Don't connect database until it works on local storage
- "So many better ways to develop software than these fucking devs"
- Don't need scrum methodologies
- Don't need to track shit
- "Just fucking build it"

### Current Projects
1. **ShoreAgents.com** - full marketing funnel with SEO, backend for clients/candidates/admin
2. **BPOC.io** - full careers platform with AI
3. **Memory Lane** - building out
4. **StepTen.io** - this site

### The Vision
> "This army thing I've been wanting to build has just always been there in my head and now I'm here; I'm living it and it's sick"
