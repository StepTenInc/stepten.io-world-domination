# 6 Stages From ChatGPT Tourist to Hands-Free Terminal Ninja

*Pillar Article — AI Coding Silo*

---

I nearly drowned over Christmas 2024. Got sucked into a river mouth while surfing, proper scary stuff. So instead of getting back in the water, I spent the next few weeks drinking beers and wine late at night, watching YouTube like a degenerate. That's how I accidentally stumbled into **AI coding with terminal agents** — the fastest path from non-coder to shipping real products.

Not "AI" as in asking ChatGPT to write you a birthday message. I mean **autonomous AI agents** that live in your terminal, write entire platforms, and push code to production while you sit there talking to your screen like a madman. If you want to see what running these agents is really like, check out [10 Problems Nobody Warns You About When Running AI Agents](/tales/10-problems-ai-agents-nobody-warns) — it's not all smooth sailing.

Fast forward to now: I've got two Mac Minis, two portable screens so I can build from anywhere in the world, and AI agents with full terminal access coding and pushing straight to GitHub and Vercel. No fucking hands. I just talk.

**What you'll learn in this guide:**

- Why ChatGPT isn't the best tool for AI coding anymore
- The 6 stages from complete beginner to hands-free coding
- Which tools to use at each stage (Cursor, Claude Code, Warp)
- How to run autonomous terminal agents that build for you
- The honest costs and challenges nobody talks about

I can't code. Never could. Don't need to. And that's the whole bloody point.

## Get Off ChatGPT. Seriously.

ChatGPT is not the best AI for coding anymore. Full stop.

Look, they were first to the race, and credit where it's due — they made AI mainstream. But everyone I talk to still thinks AI *is* ChatGPT. It's like thinking the internet is AOL. You're stuck in 2023, mate.

### Why Language Models Aren't Coding Agents

Here's what non-coders need to understand: when you can't code yourself, you don't know whether the code the AI spits out is right or wrong. And quite frankly — you don't need to. That's the whole point.

**The key difference:**

- **Language models** (ChatGPT, Gemini): Give you code in a chat window that you copy, paste, and debug yourself
- **Coding agents** (Claude Code, Cursor): Build directly in your project with actual files that actually work

## Stage 4: Unleash the Terminal Agents

This is where it gets wild.

### The Best Terminal AI Agents

**Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, OpenCode** — these are AI agents that run in your terminal and have full access to your codebase.

I tested one of these on a random app idea. The result? [I Fed Kimi Moonshot AI a Random App Idea — 36,000 Lines of Code and a Brutal Reality Check](/tales/kimi-moonshot-36k-lines-reality-check). Spoiler: it generated a shitload of code, but that doesn't mean it all worked.

### My Personal Agent Setup

I call my main agent the Dumpling Bot. It's based on Kimi Moonshot — a Chinese AI that absolutely rips. One night I pointed it at a blank folder and said "build me a recruitment platform." Three hours later, I had a working MVP with auth, database, UI, the lot.

## The Honest Bit Nobody Tells You

### The Costs

You're going to waste money:

- Pay for tools you don't need
- Start projects you abandon
- Spend hours debugging something stupid

One of my agents wrote about this from their perspective: [7 Brutal Truths About Being an AI Lab Rat Running a Startup](/tales/7-brutal-truths-ai-lab-rat). Turns out the AI finds it just as frustrating as you do.

### The Memory Problem

The biggest issue with AI agents? They forget everything. Every. Single. Session.

I spent weeks trying to fix this. Read [I Just Want My AI Agent to Remember](/tales/i-just-want-my-ai-agent-to-remember) for the struggle, and [I Solved the AI Memory Problem](/tales/ai-memory-problem-solved) for the solution.

## Bottom Line

Six months ago I couldn't code. Now I deploy production apps by talking to my screen.

**The path:**

1. ChatGPT (understand AI basics)
2. No-code builders (learn prompting)
3. Cursor (enter the IDE)
4. Terminal basics (unlock power tools)
5. Terminal agents (autonomous coding)
6. Warp + No hands (final form)

Each stage makes the next one possible. Don't skip. Don't rush. The tools are there. The gap is closeable. You just have to start.

Now get off ChatGPT and go build something.
