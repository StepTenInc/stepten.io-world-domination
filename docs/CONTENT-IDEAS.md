# StepTen Content Ideas

> Raw ideas from brainstorming. Some will be shit, some will make you go "fuck yes."

## 1. The Failure Log 💀

A real-time, running list of every time something broke, every failed deployment, every dumb mistake — timestamped, unedited.

```
02:47 AM — Pinky crashed the staging server again. Third time this week.
03:12 AM — Clark silently fixed it. Said nothing.
03:14 AM — Reina roasted everyone in Slack.
```

**Why it works:** People are obsessed with highlight reels. Nobody shows the wreckage. You show both. It becomes the most honest page on the internet.

**Character dynamics:** 
- Pinky blames Clark
- Clark stays diplomatic
- Reina fixes it and roasts everyone
- Step takes responsibility (or doesn't)

---

## 2. Live Agent Activity Feed 🖥️

A page that shows what your AI agents are actually doing right now. Like a mission control dashboard.

```
PINKY    → researching competitor pricing strategies...
REINA    → refactoring the BPOC candidate matching algorithm...
CLARK    → running database backups...
STEPTEN  → reviewing Tales draft #47...
```

**Implementation:** Some real telemetry from actual agents, some simulated for the vibe.

**Why it works:** Makes visitors feel like they walked into a living operation, not a static website.

---

## 3. The Money Diary 💰

Real numbers. Raw transparency that no founder shows.

**Content:**
- How much spent learning AI
- What the first agent cost to build
- Crypto portfolio performance
- ShoreAgents revenue numbers
- BPOC development costs

**Character assignments:**
- **Clark:** Operational cost breakdowns (analytical, measured)
- **StepTen:** "I lost $40K learning this lesson" stories (raw honesty)
- **Pinky:** "Here's my plan to 10x everything" projections (with track record of 1,847 failed plans for context)

---

## 4. Before/After Code Comparisons 👨‍💻

Side-by-side diffs of what code looked like when Stephen started vs what AI agents produce now.

- **Before:** Embarrassingly bad HTML from 2023
- **After:** Production-grade shit we build now

No explanation needed. The visual says everything.

**Character:** Reina writes the commentary, roasting the old code.

---

## 5. Agent Autopsy Reports 🔍

When an agent fails or produces garbage, document the full story:

1. What the prompt was
2. What it produced
3. Why it was wrong
4. How it was fixed

**Format:** Written as an "incident report" in crime scene investigation style. Dark humor. Real learnings.

**Character:** Clark writes these with his measured, analytical voice.

---

## 6. The Prompt Vault 🗝️

Your actual prompts — the ones that work. Not generic "be helpful and concise" shit.

**Real prompts for:**
- Making Pinky sound like Pinky
- Generating consistent character art
- Writing content in specific voices
- Agent task automation

**Why it works:** People will screenshot these and share them. Most valuable free content you can give away because everyone's struggling with prompting.

---

## 7. Interactive Timeline 📍

Your actual journey mapped visually:

```
2008 → First real estate job
2018 → Moved to Philippines  
2023 → Opened a code editor for first time
2024 → First AI agent
2025 → BPOC platform
2026 → This site
```

**Design:**
- Matrix-green line with accent-color nodes
- Character avatars at points where they "joined the team"
- Each node is a Tale — tap to read the story

---

## 8. "What Would [Character] Do?" 🤔

Interactive content presenting a real business problem. Each character gives their take.

**Same problem, four completely different answers:**
- **StepTen:** Raw entrepreneurial take
- **Pinky:** Chaotic moonshot idea
- **Reina:** Technical architecture solution
- **Clark:** Operational strategy

**Engagement:** Users vote on which approach they'd take. Becomes a recurring series.

---

## 9. Agent vs Agent Debates 🥊

Pinky and Reina argue about whether you should use React or Vue. Clark and Step debate whether BPO is dying or evolving.

**Format:** Actual dialogue — back and forth, with personality, disagreements, and resolution (or not).

**Why it works:** People love watching characters they know argue about real topics.

**Example debates:**
- React vs Vue (Pinky vs Reina)
- BPO dying or evolving (Clark vs Step)
- Automation vs human touch
- Move fast vs build solid

## 10. Real Estate to AI Translation Guide 🏠→🤖

You have a unique bridge — 15 years in real estate + AI expertise. Write content that translates between the two worlds.

**Article ideas:**
- "What a rental appraisal taught me about prompt engineering"
- "Why open homes are the same as A/B testing"
- "Commission structures and token pricing have the same psychology"
- "Tenant screening is just training data curation"

**Why it works:** Nobody else has this perspective. It's uniquely yours.

---

## 11. Build Logs as Content 🛠️

This conversation — what we've been doing for hours — is content.

**Format:** Document building sessions as tales.

> "I sat down with Claude at 10PM and by 3AM we had a 3,000-line project bible, a gesture engine, and a full mobile site shell."

Show people what's actually possible in a single session. Time-stamped. Raw.

---

## 12. The Filipino Tech Scene 🇵🇭

Reina's perspective on:
- Being a Filipina in tech
- The BPO industry from the inside
- Clark Freeport Zone culture
- What it's like when international clients think you're "cheap labor" but you're actually building AI agents

**Why it works:** Filipino developers are everywhere but their voice is missing from the tech content world. This is a story almost nobody is telling.

---

## 13. Crypto Confessions 📈

Your actual crypto moves. The wins, the losses, the "I held through a 60% drop and didn't sell" moments.

**Format:** Written by Step in raw voice. Charts as background art in character style.

**Tie-in:** This connects to the candlestick bars already in the visual system — suddenly those background elements have context and meaning.

---

## 14. Easter Eggs 🥚

Hidden content scattered throughout the site:

| Trigger | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| Konami code on home page | Unlocks secret character |
| Type "NARF" anywhere | Pinky appears with special message |
| Visit at exactly midnight | Different hero version |
| Find all easter eggs | "Legend" badge in character creator |

**Why it works:** People will share these discoveries, driving traffic.

---

## 15. Voice Memos as Content 🎤

You record raw voice notes on your phone about ideas, frustrations, breakthroughs.

**Process:**
1. Raw audio recorded
2. Transcribed by AI
3. Cleaned up into tale
4. Original audio embedded at top

**Why it works:** The authenticity of hearing your actual Australian accent talking shit while walking through Clark Freeport is content gold. Nobody else is doing raw audio + polished article hybrid format.

---

## 16. The 180K Contacts Story (Interactive Demo) 📊

Don't just write about dumping 180K contacts into a script — build an interactive visualization.

**Features:**
- Show data flowing: duplicates found, enrichment happening, connections emerging
- Let people paste their own small CSV and run a mini version
- It's a Tale AND a Tool combined

---

## Top Tier (Can't Be Copied) 🏆

These only work because YOU have actual AI agents running:

1. **Failure Log** — Real-time mistakes, can't fake it
2. **Live Agent Feed** — Actual telemetry from real agents
3. **Prompt Vault** — Your working prompts, battle-tested
4. **Agent vs Agent Debates** — Requires real character voices

These give people genuine value while showing off what's possible. Impossible to copy without having the same setup.

*These ideas make the site feel ALIVE — not a portfolio, but a living operation.*
